# Photobook
Photobook is an application that was written for the Programming Minor at the University of Amsterdam by Fabian de Moel. This application serves as a social medium on which people can share pictures. An additional feature is that it allows the user to choose the complexity of usage. For less tech-savvy users, the simple mode is enabled which increases the ease of use by keeping more complex features out of reach. This code is licensed as a public domain release. At the bottom of this page all the sources used in the creation of this app are listed.

Following are some screenshots of the Application:
